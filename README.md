# Dead Money Alpha

This is the earliest version of a Fallout mod for Victoria 3. 
This is so much Work In Progress, that there's barely even much work to speak of.

## How can I help?
The best way would be to first have a look at the [:page_facing_up: **Contribution guide**](https://github.com/Araxiel/Dead_Money-Vicky3_Fallout/blob/development/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md), the quickest way would be to [check the issues which are labelled has :grey_exclamation: help wanted or :exclamation: help needed](https://github.com/Araxiel/Dead_Money-Vicky3_Fallout/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+needed+%E2%9D%97%22%2C%22help+wanted%22%2Cno%3Aassignee+), and then just dive in with forking the repo and opening a pull request, or alternatively message [Araxiel#9240](https://discord.com/users/198974323480985601).
